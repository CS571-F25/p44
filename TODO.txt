Bugs:
- Shadow is not on the ground, 
when the player jumps the shadow's y-axis is shifted with the player

- Player can spam jump by holding down the space bar.
Jump animation can't keep up, find a way to do jump per space hit

Feature to-do
- Try messing around with drei clouds
- Enemies
- Godrays
- Attack w/Slash (you already have the gif)
    - Figure out a way to load it in (probably on a plane)
    - make it always face the direction of forward
