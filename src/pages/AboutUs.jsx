      <p>
        We are a small team working on a simple 3D web game for our CS571 project.
        Our team members are Xiao and Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Xiao is carrying this project by making all the important components of the game.
        Sun focuses on the UI, trying to make a page that is worth looking at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a small but polished web game that runs smoothly in the browser.
        It was inspired by Vampire Survivors, and MegaBonk.
